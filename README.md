**Project Discription:**

The premises of the project is to play a game of rock paper scissors against a server in a best of three scenario. The client is to select one of the three options by clicking an image of their selected option. The server is to then determine its own option of by a random number generator. A number output from the generator would correlate towards a one of the three choices. For example: the number 1 would equal to paper. The host computer will receive the server's output and compare it to the user's input. A winner will then be computed using comparison for all 9 possible outcomes for rock paper scissors. A counter for both the client and the server's score would be done server side to track which side is winning the round. If a win condition is meet, such as scoring two points over the opponent, the match can be reset by the viewer's discretion with the press of a button on the webpage.

(SIDE NOTE: add player vs player somehow. Look into how to write functional requirements)
