**Project Discription:**

The premises of the project is to play a game of rock paper scissors against a server in a best of three scenario.

A number output from the generator would correlate towards a one of the three choices. For example: the number 1 would equal to paper. The host computer will receive the server's output and compare it to the user's input. A winner will then be computed using comparison for all 9 possible outcomes for rock paper scissors. A counter for both the client and the server's score would be done server side to track which side is winning the round. If a win condition is meet, such as scoring two points over the opponent, the match can be reset by the viewer's discretion with the press of a button on the webpage.
